# How to Use the App

Navigate to the Log Food screen to start adding meals to your record straight away. You may chose to create a custom recipe and reuse it from one click in on the same screen, by using the search presets functionality. After logging meals, you'll be able to see an array of personalised statistics on your homescreen, including proximity to your RDA, and a bar chart of which Macronutrients you have had today.

The communities page contains a list of communities to which you may chose to post. These include weight-loss, vegan, and muscle gain communities. By clicking on one of these communities you can see a list of the most recent posts to this community, and also have the option to post there yourself.

Once you have posted, others may see your post by looking at your profile from the add friends section of the App. You may do the same to others. This section will also enable you to see a list of all users, a list of your friends and a list of your friend requests.
